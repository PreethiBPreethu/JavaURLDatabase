# Java URL Database

This Java program simulates a URL database with basic commands for storing, retrieving, and counting URLs.

## Getting Started

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java url database
storeurl <url>
get <url>
count <url>
list
exit


##Example Usage
Run the program from main method
storeurl google.com
get google.com
count google.com
list
exit


## Note
The program uses local variables instead of a database to store data.
The short key generation logic is implemented internally.
